### Recommendations

Number | Recommendation | Link
------ | -------------- | ----
27 | Test for undiagnosed type 2 diabetes at the first prenatal visit in those with risk factors, using standard diagnostic criteria.
28 | Test for gestational diabetes mellitus at 24–28 weeks of gestation in pregnant women not previously known to have diabetes.
29 | Screen women with gestational diabetes mellitus for persistent diabetes at 6–12 weeks postpartum, using the oral glucose tolerance test and clinically appropriate nonpregnancy diagnostic criteria.
32 | Because of the number of pregnant women with undiagnosed type 2 diabetes, it is reasonable to test women with risk factors for type 2 diabetes (Table 2.2) at their initial prenatal visit.
61 | Laboratory evaluation: A1C, if the results are not available within the past 3 months
62 | Laboratory evaluation: If not performed/available in the last year: Fasting lipid profile, including total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol and triglycerides, as needed
63 | Laboratory evaluation: If not performed/aviable in the last year: Liver function tests
64 | Laboratory evaluation: If not performed/aviable in the last year: Spot urinary albumin–to–creatinine ratio
65 | Laboratory evaluation: If not performed/aviable in the last year: Serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate
66 | Laboratory evaluation: If not performed/aviable in the last year: Thyroid-stimulating hormone in patients with type 1 diabetes or dyslipidemia or women aged >50 years
67 | Referral for initial care management: Eye care professional for annual dilated eye exam
70 | Referral for initial care management: DSME/DSMS
73 | In accordance with the national standards for diabetes self-management education (DSME) and support (DSMS), all people with diabetes should participate in DSME to facilitate the knowledge, skills, and ability necessary for diabetes self-care and in DSMS to assist with implementing and sustaining skills and behaviors needed for ongoing self-management, both at diagnosis and as needed thereafter
78 | "The DSME and DSMS algorithm defines four critical time points for DSME and DSMS delivery (7): 1. At diagnosis; 2. Annually for assessment of education, nutrition, and emotional needs; 3. When new complicating factors arise that influence self-management; 4. When transitions in care occur"
108 | Provide routine vaccinations for children and adults with diabetes as for the general population according to age-related recommendations
139 | Perform the A1C test at least two times a year in patients who are meeting treatment goals (and who have stable glycemic control).
140 | Perform the A1C test quarterly in patients whose therapy has changed or who are not meeting glycemic goals.
148 | Individuals at risk for hypoglycemia should be asked about symptomatic and asymptomatic hypoglycemia at each encounter.
151	| Hypoglycemia unawareness or one or more episodes of severe hypoglycemia should trigger reevaluation of the treatment regimen.
152	| Insulin-treated patients with hypoglycemia unawareness or an episode of severe hypoglycemia should be advised to raise their glycemic targets to strictly avoid further hypoglycemia for at least several weeks in order to partially reverse hypoglycemia unawareness and reduce risk of future episodes.
154	| At each patient encounter, BMI should be calculated and documented in the medical record.
171	| Metformin, if not contraindicated and if tolerated, is the preferred initial pharmacological agent for type 2 diabetes.
173	| If noninsulinmonotherapy at maximum tolerated does not achieve or maintain the A1C target over 3 months, then add a second oral agent, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, or basal insulin.
176	| Blood pressure should be measured at every routine visit. Patients found to have elevated blood pressure should have blood pressure confirmed on a separate day.
177	| People with diabetes and hypertension should be treated to a systolic blood pressure goal of 140 mmHg.
179	| Individuals with diabetes should be treated to a diastolic blood pressure goal of <90 mmHg.
185	| Pharmacological therapy for patients with diabetes and hypertension should comprise a regimen that includes either an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker but not both.
187	| Multiple-drug therapy (including a thiazide diuretic and ACE inhibitor/ angiotensin receptor blocker, at maximal doses) is generally required to achieve blood pressure targets.
189	| In pregnant patients with diabetes and chronic hypertension, blood pressure targets of 110–129/65–79 mmHg are suggested in the interest of optimizing long-term maternal health and minimizing impaired fetal growth.
191	| Obtain a lipid profile at initiation of statin therapy and periodically thereafter as it may help to monitor the response to therapy and inform adherence.
203	| However, therapy with statin and fenofibrate may be considered for men with both triglyceride level ≥204 mg/dL (2.3 mmol/L) and HDL cholesterol level ≤34 mg/dL (0.9 mmol/L). B
205	| Statin therapy is contraindicated in pregnancy.
207 | Aspirin should not be recommended for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease prevention for adults with diabetes at low atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk (10- year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk ˂5%), such as in men or women with diabetes aged ˂50 years with no major additional atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk factors, as the potential adverse effects from bleeding likely offset the potential benefits.
207	| In patients with diabetes ˂50 years of age with multiple other risk factors (e.g., 10-year risk 5–10%), clinical judgment is required. 
209	| Use aspirin therapy (75–162 mg/day) as a secondary prevention strategy in those with diabetes and a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
210	| For patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and documented aspirin allergy, clopidogrel (75 mg/day) should be used.
214	| In patients with known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, use aspirin and statin therapy (if not contraindicated)
215	| "In patients with known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, consider ACE inhibitor therapy, to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events."
216	| In patients with prior myocardial infarction, b-blockers should be continued for at least 2 years after the event.
217	| In patients with symptomatic heart failure, thiazolidinedione treatment should not be used.
217	| In patients with type 2 diabetes with stable congestive heart failure, metformin may be used if renal function is normal but should be avoided in unstable or hospitalized patients with congestive heart failure.
219	| Optimize glucose control to reduce the risk or slow the progression of diabetic kidney disease.
227	| Patients should be referred for evaluation for renal replacement treatment if they have estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m2.
228	| Promptly refer to a physician experienced in the care of kidney disease for uncertainty about the etiology of kidney disease, difficult management issues, and rapidly progressing kidney disease.
232	| Patients with type 2 diabetes should have an initial dilated and comprehensive eye examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist at the time of the diabetes diagnosis.
233	| If there is no evidence of retinopathy for one or more annual eye exams, then exams every 2 years may be considered. If any level of diabetic retinopathy is present, subsequent dilated retinal examinations for patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes should be repeated at least annually by an ophthalmologist or optometrist. If retinopathy is progressing or sight-threatening, then examinations will be required more frequently.
234	| While retinal photography may serve as a screening tool for retinopathy, it is not a substitute for a comprehensive eye exam, which should be performed at least initially and at intervals thereafter as recommended by an eye care professional.
236	| Promptly refer patients with any level of macular edema, severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (a precursor of proliferative diabetic retinopathy), or any proliferative diabetic retinopathy to an ophthalmologist who is knowledgeable and experienced in the management and treatment of diabetic retinopathy.
237	| Laser photocoagulation therapy is indicated to reduce the risk of vision loss in patients with high-risk proliferative diabetic retinopathy and, in some cases, severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy.
241	| Assessment should include a careful history and 10-g monofilament testing and at least one of the following tests: pinprick, temperature, or vibration sensation.
248	| Obtain a prior history of ulceration, amputation, Charcot foot, angioplasty or vascular surgery, cigarette smoking, retinopathy, and renal disease and assess current symptoms of neuropathy (pain, burning, numbness) and vascular disease (leg fatigue, claudication).
249	| The examination should include inspection of the skin, assessment of foot deformities, neurological assessment including 10-g monofilament testing and pinprick or vibration testing or assessment of ankle reflexes, and vascular assessment including pulses in the legs and feet.
250	| Patients with a history of ulcers or amputations, foot deformities, insensate feet, and peripheral arterial disease are at substantially increased risk for ulcers and amputations and should have their feet examined at every visit.
251	| Patients with symptoms of claudication or decreased or absent pedal pulses should be referred for ankle-brachial index and for further vascular assessment.
252	| A multidisciplinary approach is recommended for individuals with foot ulcers and high-risk feet (e.g., dialysis patients and those with Charcot foot, prior ulcers, or amputation).
258	| Hypoglycemia should be avoided in older adults with diabetes. It should be screened for and managed by adjusting glycemic targets and pharmacological interventions.
284	| If lipids are abnormal, annual monitoring is reasonable. If LDL cholesterol values are within the accepted risk level (<100 mg/dL [2.6 mmol/L]), a lipid profile repeated every 3–5 years is reasonable.
285	| Initial therapy should consist of optimizing glucose control and medical nutrition therapy using a Step 2 American Heart Association diet to decrease the amount of saturated fat in the diet.
294	| Consider an annual comprehensive foot exam for the child at the start of puberty or at age >=10 years, whichever is earlier, once the youth has had type 1 diabetes for 5 years.
295	| Health care providers and families should begin to prepare youth in early to mid-adolescence and, at the latest, at least 1 year before the transition to adult health care.
306	| Insulin therapy should be initiated for treatment of persistent hyperglycemia starting at a threshold >=180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L). Once insulin therapy is started, a target glucose range of 140–180 mg/dL (7.8–10.0 mmol/L) is recommended for the majority of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients
13 | Testing to assess risk for future diabetes in asymptomatic people should be considered in adults of any age who are overweight or obese (BMI >=25 kg/m2 or >=23 kg/m2 in Asian Americans) and who have one or more additional risk factors for diabetes.
14 | For all patients, testing should begin at age 45 years.
17 | In patients with prediabetes, identify and, if appropriate, treat other cardiovascular disease risk factors.
21 | Testing to detect type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic people should be considered in adults of any age who are overweight or obese (BMI >=25 kg/m2 or >=23 kg/m2 in Asian Americans) and who have one or more additional risk factors for diabetes (See Diabetes Diagnosis tab).
88 | Energy balance: Modest weight loss achievable by the combination of lifestyle modification and the reduction of energy intake benefits overweight or obese adults with type 2 diabetes and also those at risk for diabetes. Interventional programs to facilitate this process are recommended.
109	| Administer hepatitis B vaccine to unvaccinated adults with diabetes who are aged 19–59 years.
110	| Consider administering hepatitis B vaccine to unvaccinated adults with diabetes who are aged >=60 years. 
125	| "Metformin therapy for prevention of type 2 diabetes should be considered in those with prediabetes, especially in those with BMI >35 kg/m2, those aged <60 years, and women with prior gestational diabetes mellitus."
127 | "Screening for and treatment of modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease is suggested"
142 | A reasonable A1C goal for many nonpregnant adults is <7% (53 mmol/mol).
150	| Glucagon should be prescribed for all individuals at increased risk of severe hypoglycemia, defined as hypoglycemia requiring assistance, and caregivers, school personnel, or family members of these individuals should be instructed in its administration. Glucagon administration is not limited to health care professionals.
167	| Most people with type 1 diabetes should be treated with multiple-dose insulin injections (three to four injections per day of basal and prandial insulin) or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion.
169	| Most individuals with type 1 diabetes should use insulin analogs to reduce hypoglycemia risk.
172	| Consider initiating insulin therapy (with or without additional agents) in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes and markedly symptomatic and/or elevated blood glucose levels or A1C.
188	| If ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or diuretics are used, serum creatinine/estimated glomerular filtration rate and serum potassium levels should be monitored
190	| In adults not taking statins, it is reasonable to obtain a lipid profile at the time of diabetes diagnosis, at an initial medical evaluation, and every 5 years thereafter, or more frequently if indicated.
204	| Combination therapy (statin/fibrate) has not been shown to improve atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease outcomes and is generally not recommended. A However, therapy with statin and fenofibrate may be considered for men with both triglyceride level ≥204 mg/dL (2.3 mmol/L) and HDL cholesterol level ≤34 mg/dL (0.9 mmol/L).
211	| Dual antiplatelet therapy is reasonable for up to a year after an acute coronary syndrome.
211	| In asymptomatic patients, routine screening for coronary artery disease is not recommended as it does not improve outcomes as long as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk factors are treated.
223	| Periodically monitor serum creatinine and potassium levels for the development of increased creatinine or changes in potassium when ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or diuretics are used.
226	| When estimated glomerular filtration rate is <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, evaluate and manage potential complications of chronic kidney disease.
238	| Intravitreal injections of antivascular endothelial growth factor are indicated for center-involved diabetic macular edema, which occurs beneath the foveal center and may threaten reading vision.
272	| Assess for the presence of additional autoimmune conditions soon after the diagnosis and if symptoms develop.
274	| Measure thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations soon after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and after glucose control has been established. If normal, consider rechecking every 1–2 years or sooner if the patient develops symptoms suggestive of thyroid dysfunction, thyromegaly, an abnormal growth rate, or an unexplained glycemic variation.
275	| Consider screening children with type 1 diabetes for celiac disease by measuring either tissue transglutaminase or deamidated gliadin antibodies, with documentation of normal total serum IgA levels, soon after the diagnosis of diabetes.
276	| Consider screening in children who have a first-degree relative with celiac disease, growth failure, weight loss, failure to gain weight, diarrhea, flatulence, abdominal pain, or signs of malabsorption or in children with frequent unexplained hypoglycemia or deterioration in glycemic control.
290	| Estimate glomerular filtration rate at initial evaluation and then based on age, diabetes duration, and treatment.
291	| Treatment with an ACE inhibitor, titrated to normalization of albumin excretion, should be considered when elevated urinary albumin– to–creatinine ratio (.30 mg/g) is documented with at least two of three urine samples. These should be obtained over a 6-month interval following efforts to improve glycemic control and normalize blood pressure.
292	| An initial dilated and comprehensive eye examination is recommended at age >=10 years or after puberty has started, whichever is earlier, once the youth has had diabetes for 3–5 years.
293	| After the initial examination, annual routine follow-up is generally recommended. Less frequent examinations, every 2 years, may be acceptable on the advice of an eye care professional.
300	| Lifestyle change is an essential component of management of gestational diabetes mellitus and may suffice for treatment for many women. Medications should be added if needed to achieve glycemic targets.
302	| Potentially teratogenic medications (ACE inhibitors, statins, etc.) should be avoided in sexually active women of childbearing age who are not using reliable contraception.
305	| Consider performing an A1C on all patients with diabetes or hyperglycemia admitted to the hospital if not performed in the prior 3 months.
313	| There should be a structured discharge plan tailored to the individual patient.
12	| Patients with HIV should be screened for diabetes and prediabetes with a fasting glucose level before starting antiretroviral therapy and 3 months after starting or changing it. If initial screening results are normal, checking fasting glucose each year is advised. If prediabetes is detected, continue to measure levels every 3–6 months to monitor for progression to diabetes.
15	| If tests are normal, repeat testing carried out at a minimum of 3-year intervals is reasonable.
18	| Testing to detect prediabetes should be considered in children and adolescents who are overweight or obese and who have two or more additional risk factors for diabetes.
22	| For all patients, testing should begin at age 45 years (See Diabetes Diagnosis tab).
23	| If tests are normal, repeat testing carried out at a minimum of 3-year intervals, with consideration of more frequent testing depending on initial results (e.g. those with prediabetes should be tested yearly) and risk status (See Diabetes Diagnosis tab)
26	| Testing to detect type 2 diabetes should be considered in children and adolescents who are overweight or obese and who have two or more additional risk factors for diabetes.
30	| Women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus should have lifelong screening for the development of diabetes or prediabetes at least every 3 years.
33	| All children diagnosed with diabetes in the first 6 months of life should have genetic testing
36	| Annual screening for cystic fibrosis–related diabetes with oral glucose tolerance test should begin by age 10 years in all patients with cystic fibrosis who do not have cystic fibrosis–related diabetes.
38	| Patients with cystic fibrosis–related diabetes should be treated with insulin to attain individualized glycemic goals.
39	| In patients with cystic fibrosis and impaired glucose tolerance without confirmed diabetes, prandial insulin therapy should be considered to maintain weight.
40	| Beginning 5 years after the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis–related diabetes, annual monitoring for complications of diabetes is recommended
126	| "At least annual monitoring for the development of diabetes in those with prediabetes is suggested."
133	| When used properly, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in conjunction with intensive insulin regimens is a useful tool to lower A1C in selected adults (aged >=25 years) with type 1 diabetes.
134	| Although the evidence for A1C lowering is less strong in children, teens, and younger adults, CGM may be helpful in these groups. Success correlates with adherence to ongoing use of the device.
170	| Individuals who have been successfully using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion should have continued access after they turn 65 years of age.
1	| A patient-centered communication style that incorporates patient preferences, assesses literacy and numeracy, and addresses cultural barriers to care should be used
2	| Treatment decisions should be timely and based on evidence-based guidelines that are tailored to individual patient preferences, prognoses, and comorbidities.
3	| Care should be aligned with components of the Chronic Care Model to ensure productive interactions between a prepared proactive practice team and an informed activated patient
4 |	When feasible, care systems should support team-based care, community involvement, patient registries, and decision support tools to meet patient needs
5 |	A major barrier to optimal care is a delivery system that is often fragmented, lacks clinical information capabilities, duplicates services, and is poorly designed for the coordinated delivery of chronic care. The Chronic Care Model (CCM) has been shown to be an effective framework for improving the quality of diabetes care (7).
6	| Providers should evaluate hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia in the context of food insecurity and propose solutions accordingly
7	| Providers should recognize that homelessness, poor literacy, and poor numeracy often occur with food insecurity, and appropriate resources should be made available for patients with diabetes.
8	| "Intensive glucose control is not advised for the improvement of poor cognitive function in hyperglycemic individuals with type 2 diabetes."
9	| In individuals with poor cognitive function or severe hypoglycemia, glycemic therapy should be tailored to avoid significant hypoglycemia.
10 | "In individuals with diabetes at high cardiovascular risk, the cardiovascular benefits of statin therapy outweigh the risk of cognitive dysfunction."
11 | If a second-generation antipsychotic medication is prescribed, changes in weight, glycemic control, and cholesterol levels should be carefully monitored and the treatment regimen should be reassessed.
16	| To test for prediabetes, fasting plasma glucose, 2-h plasma glucose after 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, and A1C are equally appropriate.
19	| Type 1 Diabetes: Blood glucose rather than A1C should be used to diagnose acute onset of type 1 diabetes in individuals with symptoms of hyperglycemia.
20	| Inform the relatives of patients with type 1 diabetes of the opportunity to be tested for type 1 diabetes risk, but only in the setting of a clinical research study.
24	| To test for type 2 diabetes, fasting plasma glucose, 2-h plasma glucose after 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, and A1C are equally appropriate.
25	| In patients with diabetes, identify and, if appropriate, treat other cardiovascular disease risk factors.
31	| Women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus found to have prediabetes should receive lifestyle interventions or metformin to prevent diabetes.
34	| Maturity-onset diabetes of the young should be considered in individuals who have mild stable fasting hyperglycemia and multiple family members with diabetes not characteristic of type 1 or type 2 diabetes
35	| Because a diagnosis of maturity onset diabetes of the young may impact therapy and lead to identification of other affected family members, consider referring individuals with diabetes not typical of type 1 or type 2 diabetes and occuring in successive generations (suggestive of an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance) to a specialist for further evaluation.
37	| A1C as a screening test for cystic fibrosis–related diabetes is not recommended.
41	| Document Medical History: Age and characteristics of onset of diabetes (e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis, asymptomatic laboratory finding)
42	| Document Medical History: Eating patterns, nutritional status, weight history, and physical activity habits; nutrition education and behavioral support history and needs
43	| Document Medical History: Presence of common comorbidities, psychosocial problems, and dental disease
44	| Document Medical History: Screen for depression using PHQ-2 (PHQ-9 if PHQ-2 is positive) or Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)
45	| Document Medical History: Screen for diabetes distress using DDS or PAID-1
46	| Document Medical History: History of smoking, alcohol consumption, and substance use
47	| Document Medical History: Diabetes education, self-management, and support history and needs
48	| Document Medical History: Review of previous treatment regimens and response to therapy (A1C records)
49	| Document Medical History: Results of glucose monitoring and patient’s use of data
50	| Document Medical History: Diabetic ketoacidosis frequency, severity, and cause
51	| Document Medical History: Hypoglycemia episodes, awareness, and frequency and causes
52	| Document Medical History: History of increased blood pressure, increased lipids, and tobacco use
53	| Document Medical History: Microvascular complications: retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy (sensory, including history of foot lesions; autonomic, including sexual dysfunction and gastroparesis)
54	| Document Medical History: Macrovascular complications: coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral arterial disease
55	| Document Physical Examination: Height, weight, and BMI; growth and pubertal development in children and adolescents
56	| Document Physical Examination: Blood pressure determination, including orthostatic measurements when indicated
57	| Document Physical Examination: Fundoscopic examination
58	| Document Physical Examination: Thyroid palpation
59	| Document Physical Examination: Skin examination (e.g., for acanthosis nigricans, insulin injection or infusion set insertion sites)
60	| Document Physical Examination: Comprehensive foot examination (Inspection; Palpation of dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses; Presence/absence of patellar and Achilles reflexes; Determination of proprioception, vibration, and monofilament sensation)
68	| Referral for initial care management: Family planning for women of reproductive age
69	| Referral for initial care management: Registered dietitian for MNT
71	| Referral for initial care management: Dentist for comprehensive dental and periodontal examination
72	| Referral for initial care management: Mental health professional, if indicated
74	| Effective self-management, improved clinical outcomes, health status, and quality of life are key outcomes of DSME and DSMS and should be measured and monitored as part of care.
75	| DSME and DSMS should be patient centered, respectful, and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values, which should guide clinical decisions.
76	DSME and DSMS programs should have the necessary elements in their curricula that are needed to prevent the onset of diabetes. DSME and DSMS programs should therefore tailor their content specifically when prevention of diabetes is the desired goal.
77	| Because DSME and DSMS can result in cost savings and improved outcomes, DSME and DSMS should be adequately reimbursed by third-party payers.
79	| Goals of Medical Nutrition Therapy for Adults with Diabetes: To promote and support healthful eating patterns, emphasizing a variety of nutrient-dense foods in appropriate portion sizes, in order to improve overall health and specifically to: a. Achieve and maintain body weight goals; b. Attain individualized glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid goals; c. Delay or prevent complications of diabetes
80	| To address individual nutrition needs based on personal and cultural preferences, health literacy and numeracy, access to healthful foods, willingness and ability to make behavioral changes, and barriers to change
81	| To maintain the pleasure of eating by providing non-judgmental messages about food choices
82	| To provide an individual with diabetes with practical tools for developing healthful eating patterns rather than focusing on individual macronutrients, micronutrients, or single foods
83	| Effectiveness of nutrition therapy: An individualized MNT program, preferably provided by a registered dietitian, is recommended for all people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes.
84	| Effectiveness of nutrition therapy: For people with type 1 diabetes or those with type 2 diabetes who are prescribed a flexible insulin therapy program, education on how to use carbohydrate counting or estimation to determine mealtime insulin dosing can improve glycemic control.
85	| Effectiveness of nutrition therapy: For individuals whose daily insulin dosing is fixed, having a consistent pattern of carbohydrate intake with respect to time and amount can result in improved glycemic control and a reduced risk of hypoglycemia.
86	| Effectiveness of nutrition therapy: A simple and effective approach to glycemia and weight management emphasizing healthy food choices and portion control may be more helpful for those with type 2 diabetes who are not taking insulin, who have limited health literacy or numeracy, and who are elderly and prone to hypoglycemia.
87	| Effectiveness of nutrition therapy: Because diabetes nutrition therapy can result in cost savings B and improved outcomes (e.g., A1C reduction) A, MNT should be adequately reimbursed by insurance and other payers. E
89	| Eating patterns and macronutrient distribution: As there is no single ideal dietary distribution of calories among carbohydrates, fats, and proteins for people with diabetes, macronutrient distribution should be individualized while keeping total calorie and metabolic goals in mind.
90	| Eating patterns and macronutrient distribution: Carbohydrate intake from whole grains, vegetables, fruits, legumes, and dairy products, with an emphasis on foods higher in fiber and lower in glycemic load, should be advised over other sources, especially those containing sugars.
91	| Eating patterns and macronutrient distribution: People with diabetes and those at risk should avoid sugar-sweetened beverages in order to control weight and reduce their risk for CVD and fatty liver B and should minimize the consumption of sucrose-containing foods that have the capacity to displace healthier, more nutrient-dense food choices. A
92	| Protein: In individuals with type 2 diabetes, ingested protein appears to increase insulin response without increasing plasma glucose concentrations. Therefore, carbohydrate sources high in protein should not be used to treat or prevent hypoglycemia.
93	| Dietary fat: Whereas data on the ideal total dietary fat content for people with diabetes are inconclusive, an eating plan emphasizing elements of a Mediterranean-style diet rich in monounsaturated fats may improve glucose metabolism and lower CVD risk and can be an effective alternative to a diet low in total fat but relatively high in carbohydrates.
94	| Dietary fat: Eating foods rich in long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, such as fatty fish (EPA and DHA) and nuts and seeds (ALA), is recommended to prevent or treat CVD B; however, evidence does not support a beneficial role for omega-3 dietary supplements. A
95	| Micronutrients and herbal supplements: There is no clear evidence that dietary supplementation with vitamins, minerals, herbs, or spices can improve diabetes, and there may be safety concerns regarding the long-term use of antioxidant supplements such as vitamins E and C and carotene
96	| Alcohol: Adults with diabetes who drink alcohol should do so in moderation (no more than one drink per day for adult women and no more than two drinks per day for adult men).
97	| Alcohol: Alcohol consumption may place people with diabetes at increased risk for delayed hypoglycemia, especially if taking insulin or insulin secretagogues. Education and awareness regarding the recognition and management of delayed hypoglycemia are warranted
98	| Sodium: As for the general population, people with diabetes should limit sodium consumption to <2,300 mg/day, although further restriction may be indicated for those with both diabetes and hypertension.
99	| Children with diabetes or prediabetes should be encouraged to engage in at least 60 min of physical activity each day.
100	| Adults with diabetes should be advised to perform at least 150 min/week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity (50–70% of maximum heart rate), or 75 min/week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity spread over at least 3 days/week with no more than 2 consecutive days without exercise.
101	| All individuals, including those with diabetes, should be encouraged to reduce sedentary time, particularly by breaking up extended amounts of time (>90 min) spent sitting.
102	| In the absence of contraindications, adults with type 2 diabetes should be encouraged to perform resistance training at least twice per week.
103	| Included in the 60 min each day, children should engage in vigorous-intensity aerobic activity, muscle-strengthening activities, and bone-strengthening activities at least 3 of those days
104	| On the basis of physical activity studies that include people with diabetes, it is reasonable to recommend that people with diabetes will specifically benefit from following the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ physical activity guidelines.
105	| Providers should assess patients for conditions that might contraindicate certain types of exercise or predispose to injury, such as uncontrolled hypertension, autonomic neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy, a history of foot lesions, and untreated proliferative retinopathy. The patient’s age and previous physical activity level should be considered. The provider should customize the exercise regimen to the individual’s needs. Those with complications may require a more thorough evaluation (81).
106	| Advise all patients not to use cigarettes, other tobacco products, or e-cigarettes
107	| Include smoking cessation counseling and other forms of treatment as a routine component of diabetes care
111	| The patient’s psychological and social situation should be addressed in the medical management of diabetes.
112	| Psychosocial screening and followup may include, but are not limited to, attitudes about the illness, expectations for medical management and outcomes, affect/mood, general and diabetes related quality of life, resources (financial, social, and emotional), and psychiatric history.
113	| Routinely screen for psychosocial problems such as depression, diabetes-related distress, anxiety, eating disorders, and cognitive impairment.
114	| Older adults (aged >=65 years) with diabetes should be considered for evaluation of cognitive function and depression screening and treatment.
115	| Patients with comorbid diabetes and depression should receive a stepwise collaborative care approach for the management of depression
116	| The screening of all patients with diabetes with the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) and either the Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS) or Problem Areas in Diabetes (PAID)-1 scale can help to facilitate categorization
117	| A complete medical evaluation should be performed at the initial visit to confirm the diagnosis and classify diabetes
118	| A complete medical evaluation should be performed at the initial visit to detect diabetes complications and potential comorbid conditions
119	| A complete medical evaluation should be performed at the initial visit to review previous treatment and risk factor control in patients with established diabetes
120	| A complete medical evaluation should be performed at the initial visit to begin patient engagement in the formulation of a care management plan
121	| A complete medical evaluation should be performed at the initial visit to develop a plan for continuing care
122	| "Patients with prediabetes should be referred to an intensive diet and physical activity behavioral counseling program adhering to the tenets of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) targeting a loss of 7% of body weight and should increase their moderate-intensity physical activity (such as brisk walking) to at least 150 min/week."
123	| "Follow-up counseling and maintenance programs should be offered for longterm success in preventing diabetes"
124	| "Based on the cost-effectiveness of diabetes prevention, such programs should be covered by third-party payers."
128	| "Diabetes self-management education and support programs are appropriate venues for people with prediabetes to receive education and support to develop and maintain behaviors that can prevent or delay the onset of diabetes."
129	| "Technology-assisted tools including Internet-based social networks, distance learning, DVD-based content, and mobile applications can be useful elements of effective lifestyle modification to prevent diabetes."
130	| When prescribed as part of a broader educational context, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) results may help to guide treatment decisions and/or self-management for patients using less frequent insulin injections B or noninsulin therapies
131	| When prescribing SMBG, ensure that patients receive ongoing instruction and regular evaluation of SMBG technique, SMBG results, and their ability to use SMBG data to adjust therapy.
132	| Most patients on intensive insulin regimens (multiple-dose insulin or insulin pump therapy) should consider SMBG prior to meals and snacks, occasionally postprandially, at bedtime, prior to exercise, when they suspect low blood glucose, after treating low blood glucose until they are normoglycemic, and prior to critical tasks such as driving. B
135	| CGM may be a supplemental tool to SMBG in those with hypoglycemia unawareness and/or frequent hypoglycemic episodes.
136	| Given variable adherence to CGM, assess individual readiness for continuing CGM use prior to prescribing.
137	| When prescribing CGM, robust diabetes education, training, and support are required for optimal CGM implementation and ongoing use.
138	| People who have been successfully using CGM should have continued access after they turn 65 years of age.
141	| Point-of-care testing for A1C provides the opportunity for more timely treatment changes.
143	| Providers might reasonably suggest more stringent A1C goals (such as <6.5% [48 mmol/mol]) for selected individual patients if this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia or other adverse effects of treatment. Appropriate patients might include those with short duration of diabetes, type 2 diabetes treated with lifestyle or metformin only, long life expectancy, or no significant cardiovascular disease.
144	| Less stringent A1C goals (such as <8% [64 mmol/mol]) may be appropriate for patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia, limited life expectancy, advanced microvascular or macrovascular complications, extensive comorbid conditions, or long-standing diabetes in whom the general goal is difficult to attain despite diabetes self-management education, appropriate glucose monitoring, and effective doses of multiple glucose-lowering agents including insulin.
145	| A1c <7.0% (53 mmol/mol)* *More or less stringent glycemic goals may be appropriate for individual patients. Goals should be individualized based on duration of diabetes, age/life expectancy, comorbid conditions, known CVD or advanced microvascular complications, hypoglycemia unawareness, and individual patient considerations.
146	| Preprandial capillary plasma glucose <80-130 mg/dL (4.4-7.2 mmol/L)* *More or less stringent glycemic goals may be appropriate for individual patients. Goals should be individualized based on duration of diabetes, age/life expectancy, comorbid conditions, known CVD or advanced microvascular complications, hypoglycemia unawareness, and individual patient considerations.
147	| Peak postprandial capillary plasma glucose <180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L)* *More or less stringent glycemic goals may be appropriate for individual patients. Goals should be individualized based on duration of diabetes, age/life expectancy, comorbid conditions, known CVD or advanced microvascular complications, hypoglycemia unawareness, and individual patient considerations.
149	| Glucose (15–20 g) is the preferred treatment for the conscious individual with hypoglycemia, although any form of carbohydrate that contains glucose may be used. Fifteen minutes after treatment, if SMBG shows continued hypoglycemia, the treatment should be repeated. Once SMBG returns to normal, the individual should consume a meal or snack to prevent recurrence of hypoglycemia.
153	| Ongoing assessment of cognitive function is suggested with increased vigilance for hypoglycemia by the clinician, patient, and caregivers if low cognition or declining cognition is found.
155	| Diet, physical activity, and behavioral therapy designed to achieve 5% weight loss should be prescribed for overweight and obese patients with type 2 diabetes ready to achieve weight loss.
156	| Such interventions should be high intensity (>=16 sessions in 6 months) and focus on diet, physical activity, and behavioral strategies to achieve a 500–750 kcal/day energy deficit.
157	| Diets that provide the same caloric restriction but differ in protein, carbohydrate, and fat content are equally effective in achieving weight loss.
158	| For patients who achieve short-term weight loss goals, long-term (>=1-year) comprehensive weight maintenance programs should be prescribed. Such programs should provide at least monthly contact and encourage ongoing monitoring of body weight (weekly or more frequently), continued consumption of a reduced calorie diet, and participation in high levels of physical activity (200–300 min/week).
159	| To achieve weight loss of >5%, short-term (3-month) high-intensity lifestyle interventions that use very low-calorie diets (<=800 kcal/day) and total meal replacements may be prescribed for carefully selected patients by trained practitioners in medical care settings with close medical monitoring. To maintain weight loss, such programs must incorporate long-term comprehensive weight maintenance counseling.
160	| When choosing glucose-lowering medications for overweight or obese patients with type 2 diabetes, consider their effect on weight.
161	| Whenever possible, minimize the medications for comorbid conditions that are associated with weight gain.
162	| Weight loss medications may be effective as adjuncts to diet, physical activity, and behavioral counseling for selected patients with type 2 diabetes and BMI>=27 kg/m2. Potential benefits must be weighed against the potential risks of the medications.
163	| If a patient’s response to weight loss medications is <5% after 3 months or if there are any safety or tolerability issues at any time, the medication should be discontinued and alternative medications or treatment approaches should be considered.
164	| Bariatric surgery may be considered for adults with BMI >35 kg/m2 and type 2 diabetes, especially if diabetes or associated comorbidities are difficult to control with lifestyle and pharmacological therapy.
165	| Patients with type 2 diabetes who have undergone bariatric surgery need lifelong lifestyle support and annual medical monitoring, at a minimum.
166	| Although small trials have shown a glycemic benefit of bariatric surgery in patients with type 2 diabetes and BMI 30–35 kg/m2, there is currently insufficient evidence to generally recommend surgery in patients with BMI #35 kg/m2.
168	| Consider educating individuals with type 1 diabetes on matching prandial insulin dose to carbohydrate intake, premeal blood glucose, and anticipated activity.
174	| A patient-centered approach should be used to guide the choice of pharmacological agents. Considerations include efficacy, cost, potential side effects, weight, comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk, and patient preferences.
175	| For patients with type 2 diabetes who are not achieving glycemic goals, insulin therapy should not be delayed.
178	| Lower systolic targets, such as ˂130 mmHg, may be appropriate for certain individuals with diabetes, such as younger patients, those with albuminuria, and/or those with hypertension and one ormore additional atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk factors, if they can be achieved without undue treatment burden.
180	| Lower diastolic targets, such as ˂80 mmHg, may be appropriate for certain individuals with diabetes, such as younger patients, those with albuminuria, and/or those with hypertension and one or more additional atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk factors, if they can be achieved without undue treatment burden.
181	| Patients with blood pressure >120/80 mmHg should be advised on lifestyle changes to reduce blood pressure.
182	| Patients with confirmed office-based blood pressure >140/90 mmHg should, in addition to lifestyle therapy, have prompt initiation and timely subsequent titration of pharmacological therapy to achieve blood pressure goals.
183	| In older adults, pharmacological therapy to achieve treatment goals of <130/70 mmHg is not recommended; treating to systolic blood pressure <130 mmHg has not been shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes and treating to diastolic blood pressure <70 mmHg has been associated with higher mortality
184	| Lifestyle therapy for elevated blood pressure consists of weight loss, if overweight or obese; a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-style dietary pattern including reducing sodium and increasing potassium intake; moderation of alcohol intake; and increased physical activity.
186	| If one class is not tolerated, the other should be substituted.
192	| Lifestyle modification focusing on weight loss (if indicated); the reduction of saturated fat, trans fat, and cholesterol intake; increase of omega-3 fatty acids, viscous fiber, and plant stanols/sterols intake; and increased physical activity should be recommended to improve the lipid profile in patients with diabetes.
193	| Intensify lifestyle therapy and optimize glycemic control for patients with elevated triglyceride levels (≥150 mg/dL [1.7 mmol/L]) and/or low HDL cholesterol (˂40 mg/dL [1.0 mmol/L] for men, ˂50 mg/dL [1.3 mmol/L] for women).
194	| For patients with fasting triglyceride levels ≥500 mg/dL (5.7 mmol/L), evaluate for secondary causes of hypertriglyceridemia and consider medical therapy to reduce the risk of pancreatitis.
195	| For patients of all ages with diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, high-intensity statin therapy should be added to lifestyle therapy
196	| For patients with diabetes aged ˂40 years with additional atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk factors, consider using moderateintensity or high-intensity statin and lifestyle therapy.
197	| For patients with diabetes aged 40–75 years without additional atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk factors, consider using moderate-intensity statin and lifestyle therapy
198	| For patients with diabetes aged 40–75 years with additional atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk factors, consider using high-intensity statin and lifestyle therapy
199	| For patients with diabetes aged ˃75 years without additional atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk factors, consider using moderate-intensity statin therapy and lifestyle therapy.
200	| For patients with diabetes aged ˃75 years with additional atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk factors, consider using moderateintensity or high-intensity statin therapy and lifestyle therapy.
201	| In clinical practice, providers may need to adjust intensity of statin therapy based on individual patient response to medication (e.g., side effects, tolerability, LDL cholesterol levels).
202	| The addition of ezetimibe to moderate-intensity statin therapy has been shown to provide additional cardiovascular benefit compared with moderate-intensity statin therapy alone and may be considered for patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome with LDL cholesterol ≥50 mg/dL (1.3 mmol/L) or for those patients who cannot tolerate highintensity statin therapy
206	| Consider aspirin therapy (75–162 mg/day) as a primary prevention strategy in those with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who are at increased cardiovascular risk (10-year risk ˃10%). This includes most men or women with diabetes aged ≥50 years who have at least one additional major risk factor (family history of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, or albuminuria) and are not at increased risk of bleeding.
212	| Consider investigations for coronary artery disease in the presence of any of the following: atypical cardiac symptoms (e.g., unexplained dyspnea, chest discomfort); signs or symptoms of associated vascular disease including carotid bruits, transient ischemic attack, stroke, claudication, or peripheral arterial disease; or electrocardiogram abnormalities (e.g., Q waves).
218	| In patients with symptomatic heart failure, thiazolidinedione treatment should not be used. At least once a year, assess urinary albumin (e.g., spot urinary albumin–to– creatinine ratio) and estimated glomerular filtration rate in patients with type 1 diabetes with duration of ≥5 years, in all patients with type 2 diabetes, and in all patients with comorbid hypertension.
220	| Optimize blood pressure control (<140/90 mmHg) to reduce the risk or slow the progression of diabetic kidney disease.
221	| For people with nondialysis-dependent diabetic kidney disease, dietary protein intake should be 0.8 g/kg body weight per day (the recommended daily allowance). For patients on dialysis, higher levels of dietary protein intake should be considered.
222	| Either an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker is recommended for the treatment of nonpregnant patients with diabetes and modestly elevated urinary albumin excretion (30–299 mg/day) B and is strongly recommended for those with urinary albumin excretion ≥300 mg/day and/or estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m2.
224	| Continued monitoring of urinary albumin–to–creatinine ratio in patients with albuminuria treated with an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker is reasonable to assess the response to treatment and progression of diabetic kidney disease.
225	| An ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker is not recommended for the primary prevention of diabetic kidney disease in patients with diabetes who have normal blood pressure, normal urinary albumin–to–creatinine ratio (<30 mg/g), and normal estimated glomerular filtration rate.
229	| Optimize glycemic control to reduce the risk or slow the progression of diabetic retinopathy.
230	| Optimize blood pressure and serum lipid control to reduce the risk or slow the progression of diabetic retinopathy.
231	| Adults with type 1 diabetes should have an initial dilated and comprehensive eye examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist within 5 years after the onset of diabetes.
235	| Eye examinations should occur before pregnancy or in the first trimester, and then patients should be monitored every trimester and for 1 year postpartum as indicated by the degree of retinopathy.
239	| The presence of retinopathy is not a contraindication to aspirin therapy for cardioprotection, as aspirin does not increase the risk of retinal hemorrhage.
240	| All patients should be assessed for diabetic peripheral neuropathy starting at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and 5 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and at least annually thereafter.
242	| Symptoms and signs of autonomic neuropathy should be assessed in patients with microvascular and neuropathic complications.
243	| Optimize glucose control to prevent or delay the development of neuropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes
244	| Optimize glucose control to slow the progression of neuropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes
245	| Assess and treat patients to reduce pain related to diabetic peripheral neuropathy
246	| Assess and treat patients to reduce symptoms of autonomic neuropathy and to improve quality of life
247	| Perform a comprehensive foot evaluation each year to identify risk factors for ulcers and amputations.
253	| Refer patients who smoke or who have histories of prior lower extremity complications, loss of protective sensation, structural abnormalities, or peripheral arterial disease to foot care specialists for ongoing preventive care and lifelong surveillance.
254	| Provide general foot self-care education to all patients with diabetes.
255	| Consider the assessment of medical, functional, mental, and social geriatric domains for diabetes management in older adults to provide a framework to determine targets and therapeutic approaches.
256	| Screening for geriatric syndromes may be appropriate in older adults experiencing limitations in their basic and instrumental activities of daily living, as they may affect diabetes self-management.
257	| Older adults (≥65 years of age) with diabetes should be considered a high priority population for depression screening and treatment.
259	| Older adults who are functional and cognitively intact and have significant life expectancy may receive diabetes care with goals similar to those developed for younger adults.
260	| Glycemic goals for some older adults might reasonably be relaxed, using individual criteria, but hyperglycemia leading to symptoms or risk of acute hyperglycemic complications should be avoided in all patients.
261	| Screening for diabetes complications should be individualized in older adults, but particular attention should be paid to complications that would lead to functional impairment.
262	| Other cardiovascular risk factors should be treated in older adults with consideration of the time frame of benefit and the individual patient. Treatment of hypertension is indicated in virtually all older adults, and lipid-lowering and aspirin therapy may benefit those with life expectancy at least equal to the time frame of primary or secondary prevention trials.
263	| When palliative care is needed in older adults with diabetes, strict blood pressure control may not be necessary, and withdrawal of therapy may be appropriate. Similarly, the intensity of lipid management can be relaxed, and withdrawal of lipid-lowering therapy may be appropriate.
264	| Consider diabetes education for the staff of long-term care facilities to improve the management of older adults with diabetes.
265	| Patients with diabetes residing in long-term care facilities need careful assessment to establish a glycemic goal and to make appropriate choices of glucose lowering agents based on their clinical and functional status.
266	| Overall comfort, prevention of distressing symptoms, and preservation of quality of life and dignity are primary goals for diabetes management at the end of life.
267	| Youth with type 1 diabetes and parents/caregivers (for patients aged ,18 years) should receive culturally sensitive and developmentally appropriate individualized diabetes self-management education and support according to national standards at diagnosis and routinely thereafter.
268	| At diagnosis and during routine follow-up care, assess psychosocial issues and family stresses that could impact adherence to diabetes management and provide appropriate referrals to trained mental health professionals, preferably experienced in childhood diabetes.
269	| Encourage developmentally appropriate family involvement in diabetes management tasks for children and adolescents, recognizing that premature transfer of diabetes care to the child can result in nonadherence and deterioration in glycemic control.
270	| Consider mental health professionals as integral members of the pediatric diabetes multidisciplinary team.
271	| An A1C goal of <7.5% (58mmol/mol) is recommended across all pediatric age-groups.
273	| Consider testing children with type 1 diabetes for antithyroid peroxidase and antithyroglobulin antibodies soon after the diagnosis.
277	| Children with biopsy-confirmed celiac disease should be placed on a gluten-free diet and have a consultation with a dietitian experienced in managing both diabetes and celiac disease.
278	| Blood pressure should be measured at each routine visit. Children found to have high-normal blood pressure (systolic blood pressure or diastolic blood pressure ≥90th percentile for age, sex, and height) or hypertension (systolic blood pressure or diastolic blood pressure  ≥95th percentile for age, sex, and height) should have blood pressure confirmed on 3 separate days.
279	| Initial treatment of high-normal blood pressure (systolic blood pressure or diastolic blood pressure consistently ≥90th percentile for age, sex, and height) includes dietary modification and increased exercise, if appropriate, aimed at weight control. If target blood pressure is not reached with 3–6months of initiating lifestyle intervention, pharmacological treatment should be considered.
280	| In addition to lifestyle modification, pharmacological treatment of hypertension (systolic blood pressure or diastolic blood pressure consistently ≥95th percentile for age, sex, and height) should be considered as soon as hypertension is confirmed.
281	| ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers should be considered for the initial pharmacological treatment of hypertension, following reproductive counseling due to the potential teratogenic effects of both drug classes.
282	| The goal of treatment is blood pressure consistently <90th percentile for age, sex, and height.
283	| Obtain a fasting lipid profile in children ≥10 years of age soon after the diagnosis (after glucose control has been established).
286	| After the age of 10 years, addition of a statin is suggested in patients who, despite medical nutrition therapy and lifestyle changes, continue to have LDL cholesterol >160 mg/dL (4.1 mmol/L) or LDL cholesterol >130 mg/dL (3.4 mmol/L) and one or more cardiovascular disease risk factors.
287	| The goal of therapy is an LDL cholesterol value <100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L).
288	| Elicit a smoking history at initial and follow-up diabetes visits and discourage smoking in youth who do not smoke and encourage smoking cessation in those who do smoke.
289	| Annual screening for albuminuria with a random spot urine sample for albumin–to–creatinine ratio should be considered once the child has had diabetes for 5 years.
296	| Both pediatricians and adult health care providers should assist in providing support and links to resources for the teen and emerging adult.
297	| Provide preconception counseling that addresses the importance of glycemic control as close to normal as is safely possible, ideally A1C ,6.5% (48 mmol/mol), to reduce the risk of congenital anomalies.
298	| Family planning should be discussed and effective contraception should be prescribed and used until a woman is prepared and ready to become pregnant.
299	| Women with preexisting type 1 or type 2 diabetes who are planning pregnancy or who have become pregnant should be counseled on the risk of development and/or progression of diabetic retinopathy. Eye examinations should occur before pregnancy or in the first trimester and then be monitored every trimester and for 1 year postpartum as indicated by degree of retinopathy.
301	| Preferred medications in gestational diabetes mellitus are insulin and metformin; glyburide may be used but may have a higher rate of neonatal hypoglycemia and macrosomia than insulin or metformin. Other agents have not been adequately studied. Most oral agents cross the placenta, and all lack long-term safety data.
303	| Fasting, preprandial, and postprandial self-monitoring of blood glucose are recommended in both gestational diabetes mellitus and pregestational diabetes in pregnancy to achieve glycemic control.
304	| Due to increased red blood cell turnover, A1C is lower in normal pregnancy than in normal nonpregnant women. The A1C target in pregnancy is 6–6.5% (42–48 mmol/mol); ,6% (42 mmol/mol) may be optimal if this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia, but the target may be relaxed to ,7% (53 mmol/mol) if necessary to prevent hypoglycemia.
307	| More stringent goals, such as 110–140 mg/dL (6.1–7.8 mmol/L) may be appropriate for selected critically ill patients, as long as this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia.
308	| Intravenous insulin infusions should be administered using validated written or computerized protocols that allow for predefined adjustments in the insulin infusion rate based on glycemic fluctuations and insulin dose.
309	| A basal plus bolus correction insulin regimen is the preferred treatment for noncritically ill patients with poor oral intake or those who are taking nothing by mouth. An insulin regimen with basal, nutritional, and correction components is the preferred treatment for patients with good nutritional intake.
310	| The sole use of sliding scale insulin in the inpatient hospital setting is strongly discouraged.
311	| A hypoglycemia management protocol should be adopted and implemented by each hospital or hospital system. A plan for preventing and treating hypoglycemia should be established for each patient. Episodes of hypoglycemia in the hospital should be documented in the medical record and tracked.
312	| The treatment regimen should be reviewed and changed if necessary to prevent further hypoglycemia when a blood glucose value is <70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L).
